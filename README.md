# RLBotJavaExample
An example bot implemented in Java

## Usage Instructions:

1. Make sure you've installed Python 3.6.5 or newer. Here's [Python 3.7 64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0-amd64.exe). Some older versions like 3.6.0 will not work. During installation:
   - Select "Add Python to PATH"
   - Make sure pip is included in the installation
2. Make sure you've installed the Java 8 JDK or newer. Here's the [Java 10 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html).
3. Open Rocket League
4. Double click on run-bot.bat and leave it running. It's supposed to stay
open and it's OK if it says something like "75%".
5. Double click on run-framework-gui.bat
6. Click the 'Run' button

- Bot behavior is controlled by `src/main/java/SampleBot.java`
- Bot appearance is controlled by `src/main/python/javaExampleAppearance.cfg`
